# Restaurant Control System

## Overview

The Restaurant Control System is a real-time application designed to streamline the management of orders in a restaurant. The system allows waiters to place orders that are instantly sent to the kitchen and bar sections. Additionally, managers can oversee and control all operations within the restaurant through a dedicated dashboard.

### Key Features

- **Real-time Order Management:** Waiters can place and manage orders, which are updated instantly across the system.
- **Kitchen and Bar Displays:** Orders are automatically routed to the appropriate section (kitchen or bar) based on the items ordered.
- **Manager Dashboard:** Managers have comprehensive control and visibility over all restaurant operations.
- **WebSocket Integration:** Ensures real-time communication and updates between the frontend and backend.
- **MongoDB:** Efficiently stores orders, menus, and user data.

### Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React (bootstrapped with Create React App)
- **Backend:** Spring Boot
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Real-Time Communication:** WebSocket
